# üö® SafetyApp - Voice Activated Safety App

SafetyApp is a smart Android safety app designed to provide fast, voice-triggered emergency assistance. With just a custom spoken trigger word, it records a short audio clip, sends an alert SMS with the location and audio link to guardians, initiates a call, and now also allows **real-time chat** with guardians using CometChat.

## üì± Project Overview

SafeGuard ensures user safety through voice-activated emergency detection. When the user speaks a pre-set "safe word", the app performs the following actions:

- Records a 20-second audio clip
- Uploads the clip securely to Firebase Storage
- Fetches real-time GPS location
- Sends the audio link and location to pre-added guardians via SMS
- Initiates a phone call for emergency support
- Enables live **chat with guardians** via CometChat

> Powered by **Kotlin**, **Firebase**, **CometChat**, and **Android Foreground Services**, SafeGuard is always listening in the background‚Äîoffering both alerts and real-time communication.
